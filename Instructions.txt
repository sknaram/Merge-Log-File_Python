Coding Exercise:
There are 5 directories; each directory contains a file named fruit.log.
-	The log files contain continuous time based logs. 
-	The directory names have been arbitrarily assigned and do not represent the data in order of time.
-	We want to reassemble the original fruit.log file in date/time order.

Please code a solution (In PYTHON) that reassembles the original fruit.log file in proper time order.  
Once the file is assembled, get the value of the “Kiwi”.  Find the min, max, and average of this value and print it out.

Lastly, write all of the test cases, both positive and negative that you would use to test your program. 

Submit the reassembled file, test cases, and output of min, max, and average.

#Message from Sai:
Test cases, output file and Python file is located in main level with this text file
